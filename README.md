**Detecting and Blocking malicious URLs using Machine Learning (BMUsafe)**

The "Detecting and Blocking Malicious URLs using Machine Learning" project introduces a solution in the form of the BMUsafe Chrome extension, which serves as a formidable tool in fortifying web security through the implementation of advanced machine learning techniques. At its core, BMUsafe operates as a real-time protector, scrutinizing URLs and adeptly classifying them as either secure or potentially hazardous. The project's cornerstone is a streamlined linear classifier model, meticulously trained on an array of features distilled from URLs. These features include the presence of IP addresses, the length of URLs, and a thorough analysis of symbols embedded within them.
